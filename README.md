# CrypticOS
Tiny Programmable Bootsector OS written in x86 Assembly

## Programming Language
CrypticOS uses an extended version of BrainF*. The following  
is an instruction list.  
\> = +1 pointer  
\< = -1 pointer  
\+ = +1 value  
\- = -1 value  
\. = print  
\, = read  
[] = while
\! = Reset value to zero
\*Note: ASCII starts at `'A'`, so `+.++.` will produce: `AB`.  
### Why not bootstrap the OS into it's programming language?
You think that would be readable code? No.
